## 1. Project Overview

**Purpose:** A multi-tenant inventory management and card issuance platform ("calimly"). Tenants (banks) manage a catalog of card products, receive physical cards via encrypted batch upload, track per-branch stock, transfer cards between their own branches, dispose of written-off cards, generate encrypted card files for printers, and raise/fulfil inter-branch stock requests.

**Main business responsibilities:**
- Tenant & branch management (auth identity = tenant account, no separate users table)
- Product catalog (card types / SKUs)
- Batch card ingestion (encrypted `.dat` file upload → parse → validate → persist `ProductItem` rows)
- Stock tracking per (tenant, branch, product) with available/hold quantities
- Card transfers between branches, with partial-receipt/dispose/return lifecycle
- Branch stock requests (a branch asks for more of a product; another branch's transfer(s) fulfil it)
- Card write-off (disposal) with mandatory reason
- Encrypted card-file generation for print integration
- Audit logging of all CRUD and key non-CRUD actions

**Main applications:** Single ASP.NET Core Web API (no separate front-end in this repo).

**Main technologies:** .NET 8, ASP.NET Core, EF Core 8.0.27, SQL Server, Serilog (with AES-encrypted file sinks), ClosedXML (Excel failed-rows reports), Swashbuckle 6.6.2, JWT bearer auth (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`), PBKDF2 via `Microsoft.Extensions.Identity.Core`.

**Runtime/framework versions:** All four projects target `net8.0`. The API Endpoint Specification document references .NET 10 — the codebase has **not** been retargeted (see README, confirmed still accurate). Nullable reference types and implicit usings are enabled everywhere.

**Important external dependencies:** SQL Server only. No message broker, no cache, no cloud storage, no third-party HTTP integrations exist in this codebase today. No background job runner (Hangfire etc.) — batch upload runs synchronously inside the request.

Root of the repo also holds a sequence of `git format-patch` files (`R1..R6-*.patch`, `T0..T6-*.patch`, `phase1..phase9-*.patch`, etc.) — these are the delivery artifacts for each implementation phase, already applied to `main`. They are historical delivery records, not living documentation; do not treat their presence as meaning the corresponding work is unapplied.

## 3. Architecture

**Style:** Strict Onion / Clean Architecture. Dependency direction: `Presentation → Application ← Infrastructure`, with `Domain` at the center depended on by everything. Infrastructure is never referenced from Domain or Application. The Presentation layer is the composition root (`Program.cs`) and is the only place `InfrastructureServiceRegistration.AddInfrastructure` is called from.

**Key architectural patterns:**

| Pattern | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Result monad | `DomainLayer.Common.Result` / `Result<T>` | No thrown exceptions for business outcomes. `Result`'s constructor throws `InvalidOperationException` if success/error are inconsistent — a correctness guard, not a business-flow exception. |
| Response envelope | `ApiResponse<T>` (Presentation) | `{ success, data, error }` on every endpoint, success or failure. `ResultExtensions.ToActionResult(this)` is the one-liner controller convention. |
| Error → HTTP mapping | `ErrorCategory` enum | `Validation`→422, `Conflict`→409, `NotFound`→404, `Unauthorized`→401, `Forbidden`→403, `Internal`→500 (introduced for batch-upload's own boundary catch). |
| Repository + Unit of Work | `IGenericRepo<T,TKey>` + named repo interfaces, `IUnitOfWork` | Raw query predicates never appear in services; every query is a named repo method. Repos share one `AppDbContext` per request/UoW instance. |
| Multi-tenancy | `ICurrentTenant` (claims-derived) | **Not** enforced via global EF query filters for tenant — only soft-delete has a global filter (`!IsDeleted`) on `AuditableEntity`-derived types with one. Tenant scoping is manual: every repo method that should be tenant-scoped takes an explicit tenant id/scope parameter. `AuditSaveChangesInterceptor` and `AppDbContext` constructor both take `ICurrentTenant` for cross-cutting behavior (audit rows, no query filter). |
| Service façade | `IServiceManager` | One property per service interface; controllers depend on `IServiceManager` only, not individual services. |
| Lazy factory pattern | `System.Func<IXxxService>` registrations in `InfrastructureServiceRegistration` | Registered alongside most services (e.g. `services.AddScoped<Func<IBranchService>>(...)`) — ⚠️ Unclear/requires confirmation: no `ServiceManager.cs` consumer of these `Func<>` registrations was inspected in this pass; verify whether `ServiceManager` actually injects `Lazy<T>`/`Func<T>` or resolves services directly before relying on this pattern in new code. |
| Concurrency control | `[Timestamp] byte[] RowVersion` | On `CardTransfer`, `BranchRequest`, `Stock`. `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` is caught at both the service layer (mapped to a module-specific `ConcurrencyConflict()` error, 409) and, as a last-resort net, in `GlobalExceptionMiddleware` (also 409). |
| Enum persistence | `.HasConversion<byte>()` in Fluent API, on every persisted enum | Enum values documented in each enum's XML doc as "ERD value N"; new values are always appended, never renumbered, to avoid silent remapping of already-persisted rows. |
| Cross-aggregate FKs | `DeleteBehavior.NoAction` | Applied on essentially every FK that isn't a strict parent→child ownership edge, specifically to avoid SQL Server's multiple-cascade-path error and to keep movement/audit history intact even if a branch/product is later deleted. |
| Cascade FKs | `DeleteBehavior.Cascade` | Only on true parent-owns-child edges: `Batch→ProductItem`, `CardTransfer→{Products,Items}`, `CardDisposal→Items`, `BranchRequest→Items`. |
| Controller shape | One-liner actions | `(await _services.X.YAsync(...)).ToActionResult(this)` — no logic in controllers. |
| Validate-then-write | Services validate every input line before any write | e.g. `BranchRequestService.CreateAsync` loads/validates every product line before constructing the entity; `ConfirmAsync` calls `ITransferComposer.ValidateAsync` for every plan before any `StageAsync` runs inside the transaction. |
| Shared core extraction | `ITransferComposer` | `TransferService.CreateAsync`'s original logic split into `ValidateAsync` (read-only) / `StageAsync` (writes, must run inside an ambient transaction) so `BranchRequestService.ConfirmAsync` can validate every plan up front, then stage them all inside one transaction. |

**Cross-cutting concerns:**
- **Structured logging:** Serilog, writing to console plus two AES-encrypted file sinks (exceptions; warnings+ without exception). Requires `LogEncryption:Password` / `:Salt` via user-secrets/env — app fails to start (in `Program.cs`, before the host is even built) if missing.
- **Global exception handling:** `GlobalExceptionMiddleware`, registered first in the pipeline (before Swagger/auth), maps `DbUpdateConcurrencyException`→409 and everything else→500, always via the `ApiResponse<object>` envelope, and stamps `X-Trace-Id` on every response (correlates with `HttpContext.TraceIdentifier`, which Serilog also logs).
- **Model validation:** `ApiBehaviorOptions.InvalidModelStateResponseFactory` replaced with `ValidationResponseFactory.Build`, so `[ApiController]`'s automatic 400 becomes a 422 in the same envelope shape as business validation failures.
- **Localization:** `LocalizeErrorResultFilter` (an `IAsyncResultFilter`, registered as `options.Filters.Add<LocalizeErrorResultFilter>()`) rewrites `ApiError.Message` by looking up `Error.Code` in `IStringLocalizer`-backed `Messages.resx`/`Messages.ar.resx`, using the incoming `Accept-Language` header (`app.UseRequestLocalization()`).
- **Audit logging:** Two mechanisms, not one — (1) `AuditSaveChangesInterceptor` (EF `SaveChangesInterceptor`) automatically writes one `AuditLog` row per `Added`/`Modified`/`Deleted` change to any `AuditableEntity`-derived type, discovering the owning tenant by convention off a `TenantId` property; (2) `IAuditLogger.StageAction(...)`, called explicitly by services for non-CRUD or non-`AuditableEntity` actions (Login, branch-request Confirm/Refuse/Cancel, transfer creation/settlement, disposal) since those aggregates (`CardTransfer`, `BranchRequest`, `CardDisposal`, etc.) are deliberately **not** `AuditableEntity`.
- **Swagger / API documentation (added Phase S1, 2026-08-12):** No new NuGet package — extends the existing hand-written-`IOperationFilter` pattern (`AcceptLanguageHeaderOperationFilter` was already doing this). Three pieces, all in `Presentation/Swagger/`:
  - `IncludeXmlComments` is now wired for all three XML-doc-producing assemblies (Presentation, ApplicationLayer, DomainLayer — the latter two had `GenerateDocumentationFile` enabled for the first time in this pass). Every layer's existing `<summary>`/`<param>`/`<response>` doc comments now reach Swagger UI; previously none of them did, regardless of how complete they were in source.
  - `EnumSchemaDescriptionsFilter` (`ISchemaFilter`) appends each enum's numeric wire value + member doc to its schema description, reading the same XML doc files via `XmlDocIndex` — needed because no `JsonStringEnumConverter` is registered anywhere (enums serialize as plain integers; see §12 enum persistence decision) and Swashbuckle's built-in XML support documents the enum type, not each member.
  - `ExamplesOperationFilter` attaches named, multi-scenario request/response examples per action, looked up from `ExampleCatalog.All` by `(Controller, Action)`. **To extend for a new controller:** add one `Swagger/Examples/{Module}Examples.cs` file (mirrors `Errors/{Module}Errors.cs` — one file per module) building an `EndpointExampleSet` per action via `EndpointExampleSetBuilder`, then add one `Merge(catalog, {Module}Examples.Build());` line in `ExampleCatalog.Build()`. Examples are plain C# objects (anonymous types), not hand-built `IOpenApiAny` graphs — `OpenApiAnyFactory` does that conversion.
  - **Coverage: complete as of this pass (Phase S5).** Foundation (XML comments, enum filter, examples filter/catalog) plus full example content now cover all 15 controllers / ~90 endpoints: `AuthController`, `TenantsController` (S1); `BranchController`, `ProductController`, `ProductPrintConfigController`, `PrintersController`, `PrintImagesController` (S2); `StockController`, `ProductItemsController`, `InventoryController` (batch upload), `InventoryHistoryController`, `CardFilesController` (S3); `TransactionsController`, `CardDisposalsController` (S4); `BranchRequestsController` (S5). To extend for future new endpoints: add the controller's docs comments per the pattern above, add one `Swagger/Examples/{Module}Examples.cs`, and add one `Merge(catalog, {Module}Examples.Build());` line in `ExampleCatalog.Build()` — same one-module-per-file convention throughout.
  - **A genuine finding from this pass, not a bug fix:** `[Authorize]`/`[Authorize(Policy=...)]` failures (missing/invalid token, wrong policy) are handled by ASP.NET Core's authorization middleware *before* an action runs, and return an **empty body** — not the `ApiResponse<T>` envelope. Corrected on every controller (S1-S5). The rare enveloped-401 edge case (`*.ActorNotResolved`) recurs throughout — reachable on most controllers, but confirmed *unreachable* on `TransactionsController` and `BranchRequestsController` specifically (both documented as such per their own doc comments, rather than given a misleading "reachable" example).
  - **A second finding, S2:** the Printing module's admin-only write actions enforce "system-admin only" in the *service* (`Forbidden` category), not via an authorization policy — so their 403 genuinely *is* the standard enveloped `ApiResponse<T>` body, unlike `TenantsController`'s policy-driven empty-body 403. The same pattern recurs on `TransactionsController` (Create/Receive/Dispose), `CardDisposalsController.Dispose`, and `BranchRequestsController` (Create/Confirm/Refuse/Cancel) — every one of them rejects a system-admin token the same enveloped way (`*.SystemAdminNotAllowed`).
  - **A third finding, S2:** `PrintImagesController.Upload`'s `409 Conflict` is not a failure envelope at all — it returns a normal success envelope (the existing image's metadata) with the status forced to 409. Still the only endpoint found with that specific shape.
  - **A finding from S3:** `CardFilesController.Generate`'s success response (200) is a raw binary file, not JSON — hand-off metadata travels in response headers instead. `StockController.GetByBranch` never 404s on an unknown branch (confirmed by reading `StockService`) — it returns an empty page.
  - **A finding from S4, and a real doc-comment bug caught and fixed:** `CardDisposalsController`'s class-level doc previously claimed "unlike `TransactionsController`, there is no read-only admin path here at all" — false. `DisposalService.ResolveReadScope` confirms `GetAll`/`GetById` give a system admin the same cross-tenant read access `TransactionsController` has; only `Dispose` (the write path) rejects an admin token. `TransferErrors.cs` (30+ codes) and `BranchRequestErrors.cs` are large enough that Swagger examples cover only the most illustrative scenario per response code, not an exhaustive enumeration — the source files remain authoritative for the full catalogues.
  - **A finding from S5:** `BranchRequestsController.Confirm` composes `TransferErrors`/`StockErrors` directly for anything specific to a generated transfer (Known/Unknown item-id shape, insufficient stock) — a confirm hitting one of those surfaces the exact same code a direct `TransactionsController.Create` would, by design (`ITransferComposer` is the single shared validation path). Its own examples therefore mix `BranchRequest.*` codes (request-specific) with a reused `Transfer.*` code (generated-transfer-specific) in the same response set, documented as such rather than pretending every failure has its own `BranchRequest`-prefixed code.

## 4. Domain / Business Modules

### Auth & Tenancy
- **Responsibility:** Authentication (tenant + system admin), tenant CRUD, branch CRUD.
- **Main entities:** `Tenant` (is itself the auth identity — no separate users table; one account per tenant), `SystemAdmin` (bootstrap admin, outside the tenant model), `RefreshToken`, `Branch`.
- **Key rule:** Single account per tenant. JWT claims: `username`, `isSystemAdmin` (`"true"`/`"false"` string), `tenantId` (present only for tenant tokens). `[Authorize]` only — no permission/role attributes anywhere; the one exception is the `SystemAdminOnly` policy (`AuthorizationPolicies`), used to gate the tenant-management module to system admins.
- **Constraint:** `SystemAdmin` never performs regular tenant operations (create transfer, confirm branch request, dispose cards) — every write-path service rejects an admin token outright with a module-specific `SystemAdminNotAllowed`/equivalent error; admin access elsewhere is read-only across tenants.

### Catalog (Products, Branches)
- **Responsibility:** Tenant's card-type catalog and branch list.
- **Main entities:** `Product` (name unique per tenant among non-deleted rows; `ProductTransactionWay` — see Transfers below — and `UsingPrinterType`), `Branch` (name unique per tenant among non-deleted rows; `IsActive` flag).
- **Invariant:** `Product.ProductTransactionWay` (Known vs Unknown) is **immutable once cards exist for that product** (decision P6) — settlement logic depends on this never drifting after cards are in flight.

### Stock & Cards
- **Responsibility:** Per-(tenant, branch, product) quantity tracking; individual physical card records.
- **Main entities:** `Stock` (composite PK `(TenantId, BranchId, ProductId)`; `AvailableQuantity` + `HoldQuantity`, both `>= 0` via check constraints), `ProductItem` (one row per physical card; `PanFingerprint` is the sole identity/dedup key, `MaskedPan` is display-only).
- **Key invariant (Known-way products):** `count(ProductItems WHERE BranchID=X AND Status=Available AND ProductId=P) == Stock[X,P].AvailableQuantity`.
- **Key invariant (Unknown-way products):** that equality does **not** hold — `Stock` is the branch's entitlement; backing cards live in a tenant-wide unassigned pool (`ProductItem.BranchID IS NULL`, `Status = OnHold`), and which pool card backs which branch is resolved only at print time.
- **`ProductItem.BranchID == null`** means exactly two things, always paired with `CardStatus.OnHold`: in-transit under an in-flight transfer, or an Unknown-way card received-but-not-yet-printed. A null-branch card is immutable to everything outside the Transactions module (batch re-sight, status update, soft delete all refuse to touch it).

### Batch Upload
- **Responsibility:** Ingest AES-256-GCM-encrypted `.dat` files of cards into `ProductItem` rows.
- **Wire format (`ApplicationLayer.BatchUpload.BatchFileFormat`):** one card per line, `PAN|ProductName|BranchName`, UTF-8, **no BOM** (load-bearing — decryption doesn't strip a preamble), `\n` emitted (parser accepts `\r\n` too). PAN: 13–19 digits, Luhn-valid.
- **Main entities:** `Batch` (one row per upload run; `FileMac` = SHA-256 of decrypted content, unique per tenant among non-deleted rows — the duplicate-file guard).
- **Key rule:** The pipeline runs **synchronously inside one request/transaction** — no queued/async state, hence `UploadStatus` has no Pending/Processing value.
- **Known intentional gap:** `BatchUploadService` does **not** mark a `Batch` row `Failed` on an unhandled exception mid-pipeline, to avoid permanently blocking re-upload after a transient failure (the `FileMac` uniqueness constraint would otherwise block retry of the same file).
- **Secrets:** `BatchCipherOptions` (`MasterSecret` + `Salt`) — separate secret from `PanHashOptions` by design (key separation). Both fail-fast at startup via `ValidateOnStart()`.

### Card File Generation
- **Responsibility:** Produce an encrypted `.dat`-format file (same wire format as batch upload, produced by `CardFileWriter`) for printer integration.
- **Config:** `CardFileOptions.MaxCardsPerRequest` (default 50,000) — caps unbounded in-memory plaintext/base64 construction per request.
- **Errors:** `CardFileErrors` supports field-level rejection detail via `Error.WithDetails(...)` (added specifically so a rejected generation request can report *which* cards failed and why).

### Transfers (Card Transfers)
- **Responsibility:** Move cards between two branches of the same tenant; settle via a single `receive` call carrying a per-line disposition (no separate `refuse` endpoint).
- **Main entities:** `CardTransfer` (append-only — no `AuditableEntity`, no soft delete, no query filter; own `CreatedAt`/`RowVersion`), `CardTransferProduct` (one row per product line, snapshots `ProductTransactionWay` at creation), `CardTransferItem` (one row per physical card, **Known-way lines only** — an Unknown-way line moves `Stock` entitlement alone and has no card to select, so it carries no item rows at all, before or after settlement).
- **Maker-Checker identity (Unknown-way Maker-Checker workflow, decision confirmed with the repo owner):** `CardTransfer.CreatedByUsername` (required) and `.CheckedByUsername` (nullable, set at settlement) record the acting account on every transfer, Known-way or Unknown-way. It is explicitly fine for the same account to be both Maker and Checker — this system has one account per tenant, so there is no per-user identity to compare; what the workflow requires is that identity be *recorded*, not that two different identities be proven.
- **Two ways a transfer is born:** `TransactionOrigin.UserCreated` (direct create, or via a confirmed `BranchRequest`) or `TransactionOrigin.AutoGeneratedReturn` (system-manufactured to carry a partial receipt's unreceived remainder back to the source; `ParentTransferId` set; chains are **not** capped at one level — `Parent.Parent` can be non-null).
- **Settlement identity (DB-enforced check constraint):** `RealQuantityReceived + DisposedQuantity <= TransactedQuantity` per line; the returned remainder is `TransactedQuantity - RealQuantityReceived - DisposedQuantity`, deliberately **not stored** (derivable, so storing it invites disagreement).
- **Known-way settlement (current state, ⚠️ open design point per Belal's plan):** every card on a Known-way line must be given an explicit disposition (`Received`/`Disposed`/`NotReceived`) in the `receive` call — `TransferService` currently **requires** `ItemDispositions` for every item on a Known-way line (`TransferErrors.DispositionsRequired` / `DispositionCountMismatch` if missing or mismatched).
- **Unknown-way settlement (Unknown-way Maker-Checker workflow — supersedes the earlier "Unknown Inventory Refactor," which settled these lines immediately at creation/confirm):** an Unknown-way line now follows the same create → pending → settle lifecycle a Known-way line always had, just without any card to select. At creation (`TransferComposer.StageAsync`), the line moves the source's `Available → Hold` and leaves the target untouched — `RealQuantityReceived` stays `null` (pending), and the transfer always opens `InProgress` (there is no longer a case where staging closes a transfer outright, Known-way or Unknown-way). At settlement (`TransferService.SettleAsync`), the caller states a received quantity and, only when a remainder exists, a `CardTransferProduct.DifferenceAction` (`ReturnedToSource` or `KeptAtDestination`, per-line): `ReturnedToSource` mirrors the Known-way "returned" path exactly — the target's `Hold` rises by the remainder and an auto-generated return transfer carries it back, itself requiring its own `receive` call; `KeptAtDestination` instead credits the target's `Available` with the *full* transacted quantity and spawns nothing — the gap between what was confirmed and what was credited stays visible via `DifferenceAction` rather than being expressed as stock in transit. Disposal is not supported for an Unknown-way line (`TransferErrors.DisposalNotAllowedForUnknown`) — there is no physical card to write off, so `POST /{id}/dispose` rejects outright if any open line on the transfer is Unknown-way.
- **Fulfilment credit gating:** Only a transfer whose `TargetBranchId` equals the branch-request's `RequestingBranchId` credits `BranchRequestItem.ReceivedQuantity` — a return transfer heads *away* from the requesting branch, so even though it inherits `BranchRequestId` (decision D-04), it never credits (checked explicitly in `BranchRequestFulfilment.ApplyReceiptAsync`). Post the Unknown-way Maker-Checker workflow, `BranchRequestFulfilment` is the credit path for **every** settled line, Known or Unknown — a branch-request confirm only stages transfers now, it never settles one, so the "credited inline at confirm" case no longer exists for any line shape.
- **Constraint (DB):** `SourceBranchId <> TargetBranchId` (check constraint `CK_CardsTransferHistory_SourceNotTarget`), also pre-empted in the service layer before it would ever hit the DB.
- **Extraction:** `ITransferComposer` (`ValidateAsync` + `StageAsync`) is the shared core behind both direct create (`TransactionsController`) and branch-request confirm (`BranchRequestsController` → `BranchRequestService.ConfirmAsync`). `StageAsync` also takes the acting account's username (Maker identity) as an explicit parameter — actor resolution stays with each caller, matching how `tenantId` is already handled. Not covered by the composer: the 500-card-per-transfer cap (direct-create only, `TransferService.ValidateCreateShape`), actor resolution itself, audit staging, detail reload/mapping — these stay with each caller.

### Card Disposal
- **Responsibility:** Permanently write off cards, with a mandatory reason and the responsible branch.
- **Main entities:** `CardDisposal` (header; append-only, no soft delete — a mistaken disposal is corrected by a compensating inbound batch, never undone), `CardDisposalItem` (one row per card written off; rows exist for both Known- and Unknown-way disposals).
- **Why its own aggregate rather than columns on `ProductItem`:** one operational event ("water-damaged box") covers many cards; storing the reason per card would repeat it N times with no way to query "what did branch X write off last quarter and why."
- **`CardDisposal.CardTransferId`** is set when the disposal is settling an in-flight transfer, `null` when cards sitting at a branch are disposed outside any transfer.

### Branch Requests (API §4.9)
- **Responsibility:** A branch records a need for stock; another branch's transfer(s), created via `confirm`, fulfil it — fully or partially, possibly across multiple transfers.
- **Main entities:** `BranchRequest` (append-only-with-status — **not** `AuditableEntity`, no soft delete (decision Q-09), no query filter, no restore endpoint — matches the `CardTransfer` precedent), `BranchRequestItem` (one line per requested product; two independent, never-decremented counters: `DispatchedQuantity`, `ReceivedQuantity`).
- **Status is computed, not assigned ad hoc (decision D-03):** every transition except the two terminal closures (`Refused`, `Cancelled`) flows through `BranchRequest.RecomputeStatus()`, a pure function of the line counters, evaluated strongest-condition-first (`Fulfilled` > `PartiallyFulfilled` > `Confirmed` > `PartiallyConfirmed` > `InProgress`). An empty `Items` collection resolves to `InProgress`, never vacuously to `Fulfilled`.
- **Two independent counters, not one (decision D-01):** `DispatchedQuantity` — cumulative across every transfer generated for the line, credited in `ConfirmAsync` regardless of Known/Unknown way. `ReceivedQuantity` — cumulative actually credited to the requesting branch, credited by `BranchRequestFulfilment.ApplyReceiptAsync` when the generated transfer settles (`TransferService.SettleAsync`). This is now uniform across Known- and Unknown-way lines: post the Unknown-way Maker-Checker workflow, a confirm only *stages* transfers, it never settles one — the earlier "Unknown-way credits inline at confirm, before any receive call" behavior no longer exists for either way.
- **Over-fulfilment is allowed** (decision Q-03) — neither counter is ever decremented, and neither can be derived from the other.
- **Unrequested products:** a confirming transfer plan may include product lines the original request never asked for; these credit nothing on the request (decision D-05) — they're surfaced only via the derived `UnrequestedProducts` collection on `GET /api/inventory/requests/{id}`, computed at read time from every transfer linked by `BranchRequestId`.
- **Creation-time blocks:** duplicate open request for the same branch+product is rejected (`GetOpenProductIdsForBranchAsync`); requesting for an inactive branch is rejected outright (a request against an inactive branch could never be confirmed, since the branch would always fail as a transfer target); no per-request volume cap (decision Q-06, unlike `TransferService`'s 500-card cap on direct create).
- **Confirm-time block:** `plan.SourceBranchId == branchRequest.RequestingBranchId` is rejected before even calling `ITransferComposer.ValidateAsync` (pre-empts the DB's source≠target check with a request-specific error).
- **Closure (decision D-06):** `Refuse`/`Cancel` allowed only from `InProgress` or `PartiallyConfirmed` — once anything has been received, the request cannot be walked back (already-dispatched transfers still complete their own §4.10 lifecycle independently).
- **Authorization:** system admins have read-only access across tenants; every write (create/confirm/refuse/cancel) rejects an admin token outright (`SystemAdminNotAllowed`) — same reasoning as `CardTransfer.CreatedByTenantId`: there's no admin-tenant id to attribute the action to. Any authenticated tenant user may settle a transfer without a branch-level check (no per-user identity below the tenant level exists to check against).
- **Concurrency:** `RowVersion` on `BranchRequest`, added beyond the original ERD (decision Q-07) specifically so two concurrent confirm calls can't both read a non-terminal status and both generate transfers.

---

## 5. Database

**Technology:** SQL Server, accessed via EF Core 8.0.27 (`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`). One `DbContext`: `InfrastructureLayer.Data.AppDbContext`.

**Migration strategy:** Migrations are committed as source code in `InfrastructureLayer/Migrations/`. `DbSeeder.MigrateAndSeedAsync` calls `context.Database.MigrateAsync()` on every app startup (idempotent) and seeds the bootstrap `SystemAdmin` from the `SeedAdmin:Username`/`SeedAdmin:Password` config section if no admin row exists yet (logs a warning and skips, rather than failing startup, if that section isn't configured). As of this pass, latest migration: `20260810120000_U1-UnknownTransferMakerChecker`.

Model-changing commands (per README, confirmed still accurate):
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add <name> --project InfrastructureLayer --startup-project InventoryManagmentAndInstanceIssuancePresentationLayer
dotnet ef database update --project InfrastructureLayer --startup-project InventoryManagmentAndInstanceIssuancePresentationLayer
```

**Soft delete:** `AuditableEntity` base (`CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`, `DeletedAt`, `IsDeleted`, `DeletedBy`) — used by `Tenant`, `SystemAdmin`, `Branch`, `Product`, `Batch`, `ProductItem`, `Stock`. A global query filter `!IsDeleted` is applied per-entity in `OnModelCreating` (not automatic for new `AuditableEntity` subtypes — must be added explicitly per entity, e.g. `entity.HasQueryFilter(b => !b.IsDeleted)`). `CardTransfer`, `CardTransferProduct`, `CardTransferItem`, `CardDisposal`, `CardDisposalItem`, `BranchRequest`, `BranchRequestItem` are all deliberately append-only and do **not** derive from `AuditableEntity` — no soft delete, no query filter, no restore endpoint for any of them.

**Multi-tenancy:** No global EF query filter for tenant isolation (only soft-delete has one). Tenant scoping is manual — enforced by explicit tenant-id parameters on repository methods and by services resolving the caller's tenant via `ICurrentTenant` before querying. This means a new repository method must remember to filter by tenant itself; nothing in the DbContext does it automatically.

**Concurrency (`RowVersion`):** `[Timestamp] byte[] RowVersion` on `Stock`, `CardTransfer`, `BranchRequest` — guards status/quantity flips against lost updates. `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` is caught explicitly in the relevant services (mapped to a 409 module error) and, as a fallback, in `GlobalExceptionMiddleware`.

**Important tables and relationships (see `AppDbContext.OnModelCreating` region methods for full Fluent API):**

| Table | Key | Notable indexes/constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `Tenants` | `Id` | Unique `Code`, unique `Username` (both across all rows including soft-deleted — identifiers stay reserved) |
| `SystemAdmins` | `Id` | Unique `Username` filtered `IsDeleted=0` |
| `RefreshTokens` | `Id` | Unique `TokenHash`; index on `userName` |
| `Branches` | `Id` | Unique `(TenantId, Name)` filtered `IsDeleted=0` |
| `Products` | `Id` | Unique `(TenantId, Name)` filtered `IsDeleted=0` |
| `Stocks` | Composite `(TenantId, BranchId, ProductId)` | `AvailableQuantity >= 0`, `HoldQuantity >= 0` check constraints |
| `Cards` (`ProductItem`) | `ID` | Unique `(TenantId, PanFingerprint)` filtered `IsDeleted=0` (identity/dedup); `PanFingerprint` is `binary(32)` fixed-length; covering index `(TenantId, ProductId, BranchID, PanFingerprint)`; index `(TenantId, BranchID, Status)` for the unassigned-pool/availability queries |
| `Batches` | `Id` | Unique `(UploadedByTenantId, FileMac)` filtered `IsDeleted=0` (duplicate-file guard) |
| `CardsTransferHistory` (`CardTransfer`) | `Id` | Check `SourceBranchId <> TargetBranchId`; indexes on `(TenantId, CreatedAt)`, `(TenantId, BranchRequestId)`, `(TenantId, TransactionStatus)`, `(TenantId, Origin)`, `ParentTransferId`, `SourceBranchId`, `TargetBranchId` |
| `CardTransferProducts` | `Id` | Unique `(CardTransferId, ProductId)`; checks: `TransactedQuantity > 0`, `RealQuantityReceived >= 0` (nullable), `DisposedQuantity >= 0` (nullable), and the settlement-identity check `RealQuantityReceived + DisposedQuantity <= TransactedQuantity` |
| `CardTransferItems` | `Id` | Unique `(CardTransferId, ProductItemId)`; `ProductItemId` FK is `NoAction` (also blocks a batch delete cascading through an in-flight card) |
| `CardDisposals` | `Id` | Indexes on `(TenantId, DisposedAt)`, `(TenantId, BranchId)`, `CardTransferId`; `Reason` required, max 500 |
| `CardDisposalItems` | `Id` | Unique `(CardDisposalId, ProductItemId)` |
| `BranchRequests` | `Id` | Indexes on `(TenantId, RequestStatus)`, `(TenantId, RequestingBranchId)`, `(TenantId, RequestDateTime)` |
| `BranchRequestItems` | `Id` | Unique `(RequestId, ProductId)`; checks: `AskedQuantity > 0`, `DispatchedQuantity >= 0`, `ReceivedQuantity >= 0` |
| `AuditLogs` | `Id` (long) | Indexes on `(TenantId, Timestamp)`, `(EntityName, EntityId)`, `(ActorTenantId, Timestamp)`; no soft delete, immutable |

**Two-navigation-to-same-target pitfall (repeated pattern, worth knowing before adding a new entity):** Several entities have two separate FKs to `Tenants` (e.g. `CardTransfer.Tenant` / `CreatedByTenant`; `BranchRequest.Tenant` / `ActionTakenByTenant`; `CardDisposal.Tenant` / `DisposedByTenant`). Each needs its **own** navigation property — a navigation-less `HasOne<Tenant>().WithMany()` call for both would make EF Core silently reconfigure the same relationship and leave the second FK unmapped. This is called out in multiple entity/DbContext doc comments; preserve the pattern for any future dual-tenant-FK entity.

**Schema additions beyond the original ERD** (all explicitly flagged "Flagged for DBA review" in code comments — worth a real DBA pass before this platform reaches production scale): `RefreshToken` (whole table), `CardTransfer.ActionNotes` + `RowVersion`, `BranchRequest.RowVersion`, `BranchRequestItem.DispatchedQuantity` + `ReceivedQuantity`, `CardTransferProduct.DisposedQuantity`, `TransactionOrigin` enum, `CardStatus.Disposed`, `TransactionStatus.PartiallyReceived` + `.Disposed`, `TransactionItemReceiveStatus.Disposed`, `BranchRequestStatus.PartiallyConfirmed`/`.PartiallyFulfilled`/`.Fulfilled`.

## 6. APIs

All controllers require `[Authorize]` (JWT bearer) except `AuthController`'s login endpoints. Every response uses the `ApiResponse<T>` envelope. List endpoints return `PaginatedResponse<T>` inside `Data`.

| Controller | Route | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|
| `AuthController` | `api/auth` | `POST tenant`, `POST admin`, `POST refresh`, `POST logout`, `GET me` |
| `TenantsController` | `api/tenants` | `GET`, `GET {id}`, `POST`, `PUT {id}`, `PUT {id}/password`, `DELETE {id}`, `POST {id}/restore` — system-admin only (`SystemAdminOnly` policy, see §7) |
| `BranchController` | `api/branches` | `GET`, `GET {id}`, `POST`, `PUT {id}`, `DELETE {id}`, `POST {id}/restore`, `POST {id}/activate`, `POST {id}/deactivate` |
| `ProductController` | `api/products` | `GET`, `GET {id}`, `POST`, `PUT {id}`, `DELETE {id}`, `POST {id}/restore`, `POST {id}/activate`, `POST {id}/deactivate` |
| `StockController` | `api/stock` | `GET`, `GET branches/{branchId}` |
| `ProductItemsController` | `api/product-items` | `GET`, `GET {id}`, `PUT {id}` |
| `InventoryController` | `api/inventory` | `POST upload` (batch upload) |
| `InventoryHistoryController` | `api/inventory/history` | `GET` |
| `CardFilesController` | `api/card-files` | `POST` (generate) |
| `TransactionsController` | `api/inventory/transactions` | `GET`, `GET {id}`, `POST` (create transfer), `POST {id}/receive`, `POST {id}/dispose` |
| `CardDisposalsController` | `api/inventory` | `POST cards/dispose`, `GET disposals`, `GET disposals/{id}` |
| `BranchRequestsController` | `api/inventory/requests` | `GET`, `GET {id}`, `POST`, `POST {id}/confirm`, `POST {id}/refuse`, `POST {id}/cancel` |

**Request/response conventions:**
- Success: `{ success: true, data: <T>, error: null }`.
- Failure: `{ success: false, data: null, error: { code, message, category, ... } }` — `code` is stable and machine-readable (module-prefixed, e.g. `"BranchRequest.NotOpenForConfirmation"`); `message` is localized server-side per `Accept-Language`.
- Validation failures from model binding (missing/malformed fields) are normalized to the same envelope, HTTP 422, via `ValidationResponseFactory` — not ASP.NET Core's default 400.
- List endpoints accept a filter DTO via `[FromQuery]` and return `PaginatedResponse<T>` (`data`, `pageNumber`, `pageSize`, `totalCount`, `totalPages`).
- DTO naming: the Branch Requests module deliberately prefixes its DTOs `StockRequest*` (`CreateStockRequest`, `StockRequestDetailResponse`, etc.) to avoid colliding with the `CreateBranchRequest`-style naming that would otherwise be expected — worth remembering when searching for these types.
- Concurrency tokens are surfaced to clients as base64 strings (e.g. `StockRequestDetailResponse.RowVersion` via `Convert.ToBase64String(...)`), not raw byte arrays.
- Correlation: every response carries `X-Trace-Id` (from `GlobalExceptionMiddleware`, tied to `HttpContext.TraceIdentifier`), useful for correlating a client bug report with server logs.

**Versioning:** None — no API version segment in any route. ⚠️ Unclear/requires confirmation whether versioning is planned.

---

## 7. Authentication & Authorization

**Mechanism:** JWT bearer tokens (HMAC-SHA256, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`), issued by `JwtTokenGenerator` (`InfrastructureLayer.Security`).

**JWT claims:**
- `username` — the authenticated principal's username (tenant or system admin).
- `isSystemAdmin` — `"true"`/`"false"` string; drives the `SystemAdminOnly` policy and `ICurrentTenant.IsSystemAdmin`.
- `tenantId` — present only on tenant tokens (via the `CreateForTenant(string username, long tenantId)` overload); absent on system-admin tokens.
- `jti` (`JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Jti`) — a fresh GUID per token.

**Access/refresh lifetimes:** `JwtOptions.AccessTokenMinutes` (default 480 = 8h), `RefreshTokenDays` (default 7). Signing key supplied via `Jwt:SigningKey` — **must** come from user-secrets/environment; `Program.cs` throws at startup if it's empty (`EnsureJwtSigningKeyPresent`).

**Refresh tokens:** Persisted (`RefreshToken` entity), only a **hash** of the raw token stored (`TokenHash`); rotation on `/api/auth/refresh` revokes the current token and links the successor via `ReplacedByTokenHash` (reuse-detection scaffold). `IsSystemAdmin` and `TenantId` are captured at issue time so rotation reissues the same kind of token without a fresh DB lookup for that decision.

**Authorization model:** `[Authorize]` only — **no permission/role attribute system**. The single named policy is `SystemAdminOnly` (`AuthorizationPolicies.SystemAdminOnly`), requiring the `isSystemAdmin` claim to equal `"true"`/`"True"`; used to gate `TenantsController` to system admins. Everywhere else, authorization is enforced in the service layer by branching on `ICurrentTenant.IsSystemAdmin` / `.TenantId` — e.g. every write path in `BranchRequestService` and `TransferService` rejects a system-admin token outright with a module-specific error, because those aggregates' "acting tenant" FK has nowhere to point for an admin.

**Tenant isolation:** Manual, not automatic (see §5) — `ICurrentTenant` (implemented by `InventoryManagmentAndInstanceIssuancePresentationLayer.Security.CurrentTenant`, reading JWT claims off the current `HttpContext`) is injected wherever a service or the `AppDbContext`/interceptor needs to know who's asking; there's no query filter doing this for you.

**Known dead code (flagged during this pass, not yet cleaned up):** `JwtTokenGenerator` has a single-argument `CreateForTenant(string username)` overload and a `TenantId` property that unconditionally throws `NotImplementedException`. Neither is referenced anywhere in the codebase (`IJwtTokenGenerator` only declares the two-argument `CreateForTenant(string, long)`, which is what `AuthService` actually calls). Safe to delete; harmless as-is since nothing calls it, but a landmine if something ever does.

**Important security assumptions:**
- Full PANs are never persisted — only `MaskedPan` (display) and `PanFingerprint` (HMAC-SHA256, keyed per-tenant via PBKDF2, `binary(32)`, identity/dedup only). See §11.
- Passwords (`Tenant.PasswordHash`, `SystemAdmin.PasswordHash`) are PBKDF2-hashed via `Pbkdf2PasswordHasher`.
- Three independent secrets, deliberately never shared (key separation): `Jwt:SigningKey`, `BatchCipher:MasterSecret`/`:Salt`, `PanHash:MasterSecret`/`:Salt`. All three fail app startup if missing (`ValidateOnStart()` / explicit checks in `Program.cs`).

---

## 8. Background Jobs

None exist in this codebase. Batch upload — the one workload that might elsewhere be a background job — runs synchronously inside the HTTP request/DB transaction (see §4, Batch Upload). No Hangfire or equivalent is referenced anywhere in the `.csproj` files.

---

## 9. Integrations

None. No Firebase/FCM, Azure services, blob storage, payment provider, email/SMS, Redis, or APM/telemetry integration exists in this codebase as of this pass. The "integration surface" is entirely file-based: encrypted `.dat` files in (batch upload) and out (card-file generation), both AES-based and both implemented locally (`BatchFileCipher`, `CardFileWriter`) with no external service call.

---

## 10. Configuration

Configuration sources: `appsettings.json` (defaults, no secrets), `appsettings.Development.json`, user-secrets (`UserSecretsId` set in the Presentation `.csproj`) for local dev, environment variables for other environments. Bound via the Options pattern (`IOptions<T>`), one class per concern in `ApplicationLayer/Options`.

| Section | Class | Required keys | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` | — | SQL Server connection string | Committed default targets `.\SQLEXPRESS`; override per environment. |
| `Jwt` | `JwtOptions` | `SigningKey` (secret) | `Issuer`, `Audience`, `AccessTokenMinutes` (480), `RefreshTokenDays` (7) have defaults/committed values. |
| `CardFile` | `CardFileOptions` | none (all defaulted) | `MaxCardsPerRequest` = 50,000. |
| `BatchCipher` | `BatchCipherOptions` | `MasterSecret`, `Salt` (both secrets) | Validated on start. |
| `PanHash` | `PanHashOptions` | `MasterSecret`, `Salt` (both secrets, `Salt` must be valid base64) | Validated on start; deliberately separate secret from `BatchCipher`. |
| `LogEncryption` | `LogEncryptionOptions` | `Password`, `Salt` (both secrets) | App throws before host build if missing; `Directory`/`ErrorFileName`/`ExceptionFileName` defaulted. |
| `SeedAdmin` | (raw config, no strongly-typed class) | `Username`, `Password` | If absent, seeding is skipped with a warning log rather than failing startup — so a fresh environment without this configured has **no system admin** until it's set and the app restarts. |

**Never write actual secrets, passwords, tokens, connection strings, API keys, or credentials into this file.** Use `<SECRET>` as a placeholder if an example is ever needed.

---

## 11. Important Invariants & Business Rules

These must not be broken by future changes without a deliberate, reviewed decision:

- Every tenant-owned row is scoped to exactly one tenant; tenant scoping is enforced **manually** in repository/service code, not by a global query filter — a new repo method must explicitly filter by tenant.
- Full PAN is **never** persisted anywhere, logged, or returned by any API. Only `MaskedPan` (display) and `PanFingerprint` (identity/dedup) exist in the database.
- `Product.ProductTransactionWay` is immutable once any `ProductItem` exists for that product.
- A `CardTransfer`'s `SourceBranchId` must never equal its `TargetBranchId` (DB-enforced).
- A `CardTransferProduct`'s `RealQuantityReceived + DisposedQuantity` must never exceed `TransactedQuantity` (DB-enforced).
- An Unknown-way `CardTransferProduct` line's `DisposedQuantity` is always `0` — disposal is not supported for Unknown-way (app-enforced, `TransferErrors.DisposalNotAllowedForUnknown`; there is no DB constraint tying this to `ProductTransactionWay`, so a future change must not assume the DB catches a regression here).
- `CardTransfer.CreatedByUsername` is always recorded (Maker identity); `.CheckedByUsername` is set exactly once, at settlement (Checker identity). It is by design acceptable for both to be the same account.
- `Stock.AvailableQuantity` and `Stock.HoldQuantity` must never go negative (DB-enforced).
- A `ProductItem` with `BranchID = null` is untouchable by anything outside the Transactions module (no re-sight, no status update, no soft delete).
- `BranchRequestItem.DispatchedQuantity` and `.ReceivedQuantity` are cumulative and **never decremented** — over-fulfilment is allowed by design (decision Q-03).
- A return transfer (`TransactionOrigin.AutoGeneratedReturn`) inherits its parent's `BranchRequestId` but must never credit `BranchRequestItem.ReceivedQuantity` — fulfilment credit is gated strictly on `TargetBranchId == RequestingBranchId`.
- `BranchRequest.RequestStatus` is only ever assigned directly for the two terminal closures (`Refused`, `Cancelled`); every other transition must go through `RecomputeStatus()`.
- `BranchRequest`/`CardTransfer`/`CardDisposal`/their line-item types are append-only: no soft delete, no restore endpoint, no `AuditableEntity`. Do not add soft-delete to these without revisiting every place that currently assumes they're permanent (audit trail integrity, `RecomputeStatus`, disposal irreversibility).
- A system admin can never create or settle a transfer, or create/confirm/refuse/cancel a branch request — every such write path must keep rejecting an admin token outright, because these aggregates' "acting tenant" columns are non-nullable FKs with nowhere for an admin id to go.
- Card disposal is deliberately irreversible; a mistaken disposal is corrected by a compensating inbound batch, never by "undoing" the disposal record.
- Three cryptographic secrets (JWT signing key, batch-cipher master secret, PAN-hash master secret) must remain independent — never derive one from another, never let a rotation of one implicitly affect another.

## 12. Important Technical Decisions

### Decision: Result pattern instead of exceptions for business outcomes
**Status:** Active
**Decision:** All service-layer business outcomes return `Result`/`Result<T>`; exceptions are reserved for truly unexpected faults, caught only by `GlobalExceptionMiddleware`.
**Reason:** Deterministic, type-safe error handling; `ErrorCategory` gives a single source of truth for HTTP status mapping without inspecting message text.
**Impact:** Any new service method must return `Result`/`Result<T>`, not throw, for expected failure modes. `DbUpdateConcurrencyException`/`DbUpdateException` from EF Core are the one place exceptions are still explicitly caught inside services (concurrency/persistence conflicts), because EF Core itself throws for those rather than returning a value.

### Decision: Manual tenant scoping, not global EF query filters
**Status:** Active
**Decision:** Only soft-delete uses a global query filter; tenant isolation is enforced by explicit tenant-id parameters through repositories and services.
**Reason:** ⚠️ Unclear/requires confirmation — not stated explicitly in code comments found during this pass. Plausible reasons include needing system-admin cross-tenant reads (which a blanket filter would complicate) and wanting explicit, auditable tenant checks at each call site rather than implicit ones.
**Impact:** Every new repository method touching a tenant-owned table must take and apply a tenant scope parameter itself. There is no safety net if one is forgotten — this is the single highest-risk pattern in the codebase from a security standpoint and deserves care in review.

### Decision: `ProductTransactionWay` split (Known vs Unknown) drives most of the Transfers/Branch-Requests complexity
**Status:** Active
**Decision:** A product's items are either individually tracked (`Known`) or only tracked by quantity (`Unknown`), snapshotted onto each transfer line at creation time.
**Reason:** Some card types (per the business domain) are never individually serialized/tracked by the tenant; forcing item-level tracking on them would be both false precision and an operational burden.
**Alternatives considered:** ⚠️ Unclear/requires confirmation.
**Impact:** Almost every settlement code path (`TransferService.receive`, `BranchRequestFulfilment`, `ITransferComposer.StageAsync`) branches on this value. Any new feature touching transfers or branch requests must handle both paths — Unknown-way is not a degenerate case of Known-way, it has genuinely different data flow (no `CardTransferItem` rows ever, no disposal support). Since the Unknown-way Maker-Checker workflow, both ways *do* share the same create → pending → settle shape and the same settlement entry point (`POST /{id}/receive`); the remaining difference is that Unknown-way resolves its remainder via a per-line `DifferenceAction` instead of per-card dispositions, and never supports disposal.

### Decision: Unknown-way Maker-Checker workflow (supersedes the "Unknown Inventory Refactor")
**Status:** Active
**Decision:** An Unknown-way transfer line no longer settles immediately at creation/confirm. It follows the same create (`Available → Hold` at the source only) → pending (`InProgress`) → settle (`receive`) lifecycle a Known-way line already had. At settlement, a remainder is resolved per line via `CardTransferProduct.DifferenceAction`: `ReturnedToSource` spawns an auto-generated return transfer exactly like the Known-way "returned" path; `KeptAtDestination` credits the target's `Available` with the full transacted quantity and spawns nothing, leaving the received-vs-credited gap visible via `DifferenceAction` rather than expressed as stock in transit. Disposal is not supported for Unknown-way — there is no physical card to write off.
**Reason:** The prior "settle immediately" behavior gave Unknown-way transfers no maker/checker separation and no window to correct a quantity discrepancy before it became final stock movement — this workflow was requested specifically to close that gap.
**Impact:** `CardTransfer.CreatedByUsername`/`.CheckedByUsername` (new, not in the original ERD) record the acting account's identity on every transfer, Known- or Unknown-way — it is explicitly acceptable for the same account to be both, since this system has one account per tenant and there is no per-user identity to compare; the requirement is that identity be recorded, not that two distinct identities be proven. `BranchRequestFulfilment.ApplyReceiptAsync` is now the credit path for every settled line regardless of way (§4, Branch Requests). `ReceiveTransferLine.DifferenceAction` and `TransferProductResponse.DifferenceAction` are new DTO fields; four new `TransferErrors` cover the Unknown-way settlement validation (`DifferenceActionRequired`, `DifferenceActionNotApplicable`, `InvalidDifferenceAction`, `DisposalNotAllowedForUnknown`).

### Decision: `ITransferComposer` extraction (Validate/Stage split)
**Status:** Active
**Decision:** `TransferService.CreateAsync`'s original monolithic logic was split into `ValidateAsync` (read-only) and `StageAsync` (writes, must run inside an ambient transaction), exposed as `ITransferComposer`, so `BranchRequestService.ConfirmAsync` can validate every plan across multiple transfers before staging any of them.
**Reason:** A branch-request confirm can generate N transfers from N source branches in one call; validating all N up front (fail before any write) requires the validate/write split that a single monolithic `CreateAsync` didn't have.
**Alternatives considered:** ⚠️ Unclear/requires confirmation.
**Impact:** Any future change to transfer creation rules (branch/product validation, Known/Unknown item-id shape rules, card selection) must go in `TransferComposer`, not duplicated in `TransferService` or `BranchRequestService` — both callers depend on it staying the single source of truth.

### Decision: Two independent branch-request counters (`DispatchedQuantity`, `ReceivedQuantity`)
**Status:** Active
**Decision:** A `BranchRequestItem` tracks how much was sent and how much actually arrived as two separate, never-decremented counters rather than one.
**Reason:** Over-fulfilment is allowed (Q-03), so neither value is derivable from the other; "how much was sent" and "how much arrived" answer genuinely different questions once returns/disposals are possible mid-flight.
**Impact:** `RecomputeStatus()` reads both; any new fulfilment path must credit the correct one at the correct time (dispatched at confirm/stage time, received at settlement time — uniformly for Known- and Unknown-way since the Unknown-way Maker-Checker workflow).

---

## 13. Known Constraints

- **Target framework mismatch:** the API Endpoint Specification document references .NET 10; the actual codebase targets `net8.0` throughout and has not been retargeted (confirmed in README and every `.csproj`). Do not assume .NET 10-only features are available.
- **No test project exists in the repository** as of this pass (confirmed by filesystem search) — Phase 8 (batch-upload test suite) and the card-file-generation round-trip integration test (§9.8) remain open per prior planning notes; there is currently no automated regression safety net for any module.
- **No async/queued processing** — batch upload's synchronous-in-request design means very large files will hold a DB transaction open for the whole pipeline; there is no chunking or background-job path today.
- **SQL Server only** — no abstraction layer for a different provider; Fluent API uses SQL Server-specific constructs (`binary(32)`, `GETUTCDATE()`, filtered indexes with `[Col] = 0` syntax).
- **Single system admin bootstrap, no admin management UI/API beyond seeding** — `SystemAdmin` rows exist as a table (rotatable/auditable per its own doc comment) but no controller currently manages them beyond the one seeded at startup; ⚠️ Unclear/requires confirmation whether additional system-admin management endpoints are planned.

---

## 14. Development Workflow

**Build:**
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

**Run:**
```bash
dotnet run --project InventoryManagmentAndInstanceIssuancePresentationLayer
```

**Migrations:**
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add <name> --project InfrastructureLayer --startup-project InventoryManagmentAndInstanceIssuancePresentationLayer
dotnet ef database update --project InfrastructureLayer --startup-project InventoryManagmentAndInstanceIssuancePresentationLayer
```

**Local development requirements:** .NET 8 SDK, SQL Server (LocalDB/Express/full), and the following via `dotnet user-secrets` (Presentation project's `UserSecretsId` is already set) before the app will start:
- `Jwt:SigningKey`
- `BatchCipher:MasterSecret`, `BatchCipher:Salt`
- `PanHash:MasterSecret`, `PanHash:Salt` (Salt must be valid base64)
- `LogEncryption:Password`, `LogEncryption:Salt`
- `SeedAdmin:Username`, `SeedAdmin:Password` (optional — skipped with a warning if absent, but then no admin exists)

**Session/delivery convention used on this project (not a tooling requirement, but the established working pattern with the AI pairing on this repo):** one phase per session, delivered as a `git format-patch`-style file, applied and pushed by the repo owner between sessions. See the root-level `*.patch` files for the full delivery history.

**Test commands:** ⚠️ No test project exists — nothing to run yet (see §13).

---

## 15. Deployment / Infrastructure

⚠️ Unclear / requires confirmation — no CI/CD configuration (GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, etc.), Dockerfile, or deployment manifest was found in the repository during this pass. No environment-specific `appsettings.*.json` beyond `Development` was found. This section should be filled in once a real deployment pipeline exists; do not invent one.

---

## 16. Testing Strategy

No test project exists in the repository (confirmed by filesystem search during this pass — see §13). Verification of new code during development has instead relied on:
- Roslyn semantic compilation against the real layer DLLs (no `dotnet` SDK available in some working sandboxes).
- Python round-trip simulation for cipher/parser logic when a full .NET toolchain isn't available.
- OpenAPI YAML validation (`openapi-spec-validator`) where relevant.

**Areas most in need of real automated regression coverage**, given their complexity and the number of interacting invariants (§11):
- `TransferService` settlement (`receive`/`dispose`), especially the Known/Unknown disposition validation and the auto-generated-return chain.
- `BranchRequestService.ConfirmAsync` + `ITransferComposer` interaction (multi-transfer confirm, partial validation-then-stage).
- `BranchRequestFulfilment.ApplyReceiptAsync` credit gating (D-04/D-05).
- Batch upload end-to-end (decrypt → parse → validate → persist → failed-rows report), including the "no Failed status on transient exception" behavior.
- PAN fingerprint/masking round-trip and per-tenant key derivation.

---

## 17. Known Risks / Technical Debt

- **Manual tenant scoping (see §11, §12):** no compiler or runtime safety net catches a repository method that forgets to filter by tenant. Impact: potential cross-tenant data leakage from a single missed parameter. Current workaround: code review discipline + the established "explicit tenant scope parameter" convention. Possible future direction: a global query filter keyed off `ICurrentTenant`, with an explicit bypass mechanism for system-admin reads (mirroring how soft-delete's filter already works).
- **Dead code in `JwtTokenGenerator`:** unused `CreateForTenant(string)` overload and a `TenantId` property that throws `NotImplementedException`. Impact: low (nothing calls it) but it's a landmine for a future caller who reaches for the wrong overload. Workaround: none needed today. Future direction: delete both members.
- **No automated test suite:** see §13/§16. Impact: regressions in the (numerous, intricate) settlement/fulfilment invariants are only caught by manual review or production incidents. Future direction: stand up the Phase 8 batch-upload test suite and the §9.8 card-file round-trip test that were already planned but never delivered, then expand to Transfers/Branch-Requests.
- **Schema additions beyond the original ERD, several "Flagged for DBA review" in code comments** (full list in §5): functionally shipped and working, but not yet formally reviewed against the ERD by a DBA as the comments themselves note. Impact: low functional risk, but a formal reconciliation pass against the ERD document would reduce drift risk for future schema work.
- **Known-way transfer settlement requires explicit per-card dispositions from the caller** (see §4, Transfers): currently the only supported shape; per prior planning notes this was flagged as an open design question rather than a settled decision. Confirm with the repo owner before changing — this is core settlement logic touched by both direct transfers and branch-request fulfilment.
- **`SeedAdmin` silently skips seeding when unconfigured**, logging only a warning. Impact: a fresh environment can come up with zero system admins and no obvious startup failure pointing at why admin login doesn't work. Future direction: consider making this configurable-but-loud (e.g. a startup log at `Error` level, or a documented health-check).

---

## 18. Change History

Keep this section SHORT — only major architectural or behavioral changes.

- **2026-08-10:** Initial creation of this document via full repository read (entities, DbContext, contracts, repositories, services, controllers, DI wiring, security, options/config, migrations, localization). Confirmed README's "not yet implemented" closing paragraph is stale — entities, DbContext, repositories, services, and controllers are all implemented; flagged for the repo owner to update or remove. Branch Requests module (API §4.9) confirmed fully implemented end-to-end (R1–R6 committed), superseding an earlier "service/controller pending" status.
- **2026-08-10 (same day, follow-up pass):** Unknown-way Maker-Checker workflow implemented (migration `U1-UnknownTransferMakerChecker`). Unknown-way transfer lines no longer settle immediately at creation/confirm — they now follow the same create → pending → settle lifecycle Known-way lines already had, with remainder resolution via a new per-line `DifferenceAction` (`ReturnedToSource`/`KeptAtDestination`) instead of per-card dispositions, and no disposal support. `CardTransfer.CreatedByUsername`/`.CheckedByUsername` record Maker/Checker identity on every transfer — same account for both is explicitly acceptable, since this system has one account per tenant (§7) and there is no per-user identity to compare. This also changes Branch Requests (§4.9) behavior: an Unknown-way line confirmed via a branch request no longer credits `ReceivedQuantity` inline at confirm time — `BranchRequestFulfilment.ApplyReceiptAsync` is now the credit path for every settled line, Known or Unknown. Corrected two pre-existing stale claims found during this pass: `CardTransferItem`'s doc comment and this document's own §4 previously (incorrectly) stated Unknown-way lines get item rows — they never have, in code. **Verification note:** this pass had no .NET SDK or NuGet access in the working sandbox, so changes were verified by careful manual re-read rather than the usual Roslyn semantic compile — a real build pass is recommended before merging.
- **2026-08-12 (Swagger documentation, Phase S1 of a 5-phase plan):** Wired `IncludeXmlComments` for the first time across all three XML-doc-producing assemblies (previously only the Presentation project had `GenerateDocumentationFile` enabled, and `IncludeXmlComments` was never called at all — no existing XML doc comment, however complete, ever reached Swagger UI). Added `EnumSchemaDescriptionsFilter` and `ExamplesOperationFilter`/`ExampleCatalog` (see §3, "Swagger / API documentation" — no new NuGet package, extends the existing hand-written-filter pattern). Full example content delivered for `AuthController` and `TenantsController` only; S2-S5 cover the remaining 13 controllers. Found and corrected a real inaccuracy while building this: several `[ProducesResponseType]` declarations for 401/403 claimed a typed `ApiResponse<T>` envelope body for responses that the ASP.NET Core authorization middleware actually returns empty — fixed on Auth/Tenants, flagged as an open per-controller audit item for S2-S5 (§3). Also fixed a stale `<param name="TenantId">` doc on `CurrentPrincipalResponse` (ApplicationLayer/DTOs/Auth/AuthDtos.cs) that documented a parameter the record doesn't have. **Verification note:** same sandbox constraint as the entry above — no .NET SDK/NuGet access, verified by manual cross-check of every new file (brace balance, using statements, cref resolution, exact codes/messages against the real `*Service`/`*Errors` source) rather than a real build; a real `dotnet build` is recommended before merging.
- **2026-08-12 (same day, Swagger documentation Phase S2):** Full example content delivered for the Catalog & Printing modules: `BranchController`, `ProductController`, `ProductPrintConfigController`, `PrintersController`, `PrintImagesController` (29 endpoints). Continued the per-controller 401/403 accuracy audit from S1 (§3) — found the opposite issue this time: the Printing module's admin-only write actions enforce "system-admin only" in the service (`Forbidden` category), not via an authorization policy, so their 403 genuinely *is* the enveloped body (unlike `TenantsController`'s policy-driven empty-body 403 from S1) — documented explicitly so the distinction doesn't get flattened into a blanket rule. Also found and documented `PrintImagesController.Upload`'s 409, which uniquely returns a *success* envelope (the existing image's metadata) with the status forced to 409, not an `ApiError` — the only non-2xx-without-ApiError response found in the API so far. Backfilled missing `<response>` XML doc tags on all 29 actions across these 5 controllers (same "attributes present but no descriptive text" gap flagged, but not yet fully closed, in S1). **Verification note:** same sandbox constraint — no .NET SDK/NuGet access; every new/edited file was manually cross-checked (brace/paren balance via script, exact codes/messages against `BranchErrors`/`ProductErrors`/`PrintingErrors` and the corresponding `*Service` classes) rather than a real build.
- **2026-08-12 (same day, Swagger documentation Phase S3):** Full example content delivered for Stock & Cards: `StockController`, `ProductItemsController`, `InventoryController` (batch upload), `InventoryHistoryController`, `CardFilesController` (13 endpoints — the smallest phase by count, but the most varied response shapes). Confirmed via `StockService` that `GetByBranch` never 404s on an unknown branch (returns an empty page). Documented `CardFilesController.Generate`'s success response as the second confirmed non-JSON 200 in the API (the file itself, with hand-off metadata in `X-File-Mac`/`X-Card-Count`/`X-Expected-Row-Count` headers — mirrors `PrintImagesController.Get`'s raw-bytes 200 from S2, though that one has no metadata headers to speak of). Continued the enveloped-401-edge-case pattern from S1/S2 on `InventoryController.Upload` (`Batch.ActorNotResolved`) and `CardFilesController.Generate` (`CardFile.ActorNotResolved`). Backfilled missing `<response>` XML doc tags on all 13 actions. **Verification note:** same sandbox constraint — no .NET SDK/NuGet access; every new/edited file was manually cross-checked (brace/paren balance via script, exact codes/messages against `StockErrors`/`ProductItemErrors`/`BatchErrors`/`CardFileErrors` and the corresponding `*Service` classes) rather than a real build.
- **2026-08-12 (same day, Swagger documentation Phase S4):** Full example content delivered for Transfers & Disposal: `TransactionsController`, `CardDisposalsController` (8 endpoints, the most complex business rules in the API — `TransferErrors.cs` alone has 30+ codes). Caught and fixed a real pre-existing doc-comment bug while reading `DisposalService` directly: `CardDisposalsController`'s class doc claimed no read-only admin path exists on this controller at all, but `ResolveReadScope` confirms `GetAll`/`GetById` do give a system admin cross-tenant read access, exactly like `TransactionsController` — only the write path (`Dispose`) rejects an admin token. Also confirmed `Transfer.ActorNotResolved` is, per its own doc comment, unreachable behind `[Authorize]` with a valid tenant token, and documented it as such rather than manufacturing a misleading "reachable" example. Given the size of `TransferErrors.cs`, Swagger examples cover only the most illustrative scenario per response code (e.g. one representative 422 per action, not all ~10 possible ones) — the source file remains authoritative for the full catalogue. Backfilled missing `<response>` XML doc tags on all 8 actions. **Verification note:** same sandbox constraint — no .NET SDK/NuGet access; every new/edited file was manually cross-checked (brace/paren balance via script, exact codes/messages against `TransferErrors`/`DisposalErrors` and the corresponding `*Service`/`ITransferComposer` classes) rather than a real build.
- **2026-08-12 (same day, Swagger documentation Phase S5 — final phase):** Full example content delivered for `BranchRequestsController` (6 endpoints — the seven-status demand-ledger workflow that composes `TransactionsController`'s transfers). Confirmed via `BranchRequestService` that, like `TransactionsController`, `GetAll`/`GetById` give a system admin cross-tenant read access while `Create`/`Confirm`/`Refuse`/`Cancel` all reject an admin token — this controller's own doc comment already stated this accurately, no correction needed (contrast with the `CardDisposalsController` bug found in S4). Documented that `Confirm`'s generated-transfer failures reuse `TransferErrors`/`StockErrors` directly (via `ITransferComposer`, the same validation path a direct `TransactionsController.Create` uses) rather than duplicating codes under a `BranchRequest.*` prefix — its examples mix both prefixes in the same response set for that reason. Backfilled missing `<response>` XML doc tags on all 6 actions. **This closes the Swagger documentation initiative: all 15 controllers / ~90 endpoints now have full example coverage, foundation applies uniformly, and the extension pattern for future endpoints is documented above.** **Verification note:** same sandbox constraint — no .NET SDK/NuGet access; every new/edited file was manually cross-checked (brace/paren balance via script, exact codes/messages against `BranchRequestErrors` and `BranchRequestService`) rather than a real build. A real `dotnet build` across all five phases together is still recommended before considering this initiative fully closed out.
